The code file Group29.ipynb contains all the phases and their results. The viewer.zip and viewer_assets.zip file contains the index.html and cameras.json files respectively in their correct directories, simply unzip both files to run. There is an additional ply file made using meshlab which is not uploaded. This ply file is also needed to run the reconstruction. Once you have all these dependencies, write this command in terminal to launch python3 -m http.server 8000 and open http://localhost:8000/viewer/ in a browser. 

The data.zip contains all the images. It contains 24 images of my hostel room.

The outputs for each phase are labelled as such (phase_2_xxxx is the result of phase 2 and phase_3_xxx is the output of phase 3). You can also check where the outputs are being made in the main notebook.

Group29_CV_Report.pdf as the name suggests contains the groups report (also submitted on lms).
