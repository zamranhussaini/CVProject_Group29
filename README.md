The code file Group29_PhaseX contains all the phases as of that phase, so e.g Group29_Phase3 contains code for Phases 1 and 2 as well as Phase 3.

The data.zip contains all the images. This could change later but for now its just a some pics taken on an iPhone 11 of my hostel room.

The outputs for each phase are labelled as such (phase_2_xxxx is the result of phase 2 and phase_3_xxx is the output of phase 3).
